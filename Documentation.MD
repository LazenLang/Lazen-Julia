# The Lazen Programming Language

<h2>Why ?</h2>
Lazen is designed to be simple, safe and elegant.<br>
It aims to re-introduce clever computer programming concepts/features in a "better" or "simpler" way.
At the moment, this language has no real reason for you to give of your time for it. Documentation is still interesting.
<br><br>
The language's compiler is not implemented yet.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Concatenation</h3>
Concatenation is done by using the PLUS (+) operator.<br>
Concatenation always returns a String if one of the operand is (a name or a value) of type String or Char.
