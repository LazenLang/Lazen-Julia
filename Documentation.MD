# The Lazen Programming Language

<h2>Why ?</h2>
Lazen is designed to be simple, safe and elegant.<br>
It aims to re-introduce clever computer programming concepts/features in a "better" or "simpler" way.
At the moment, this language has no real reason for you to give of your time for it. Documentation is still interesting.
<br><br>
The language's compiler is not implemented yet.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Concatenation</h3>
Concatenation is done by using the PLUS (+) operator and always results a String if one of the operand's type is<br>
String or Char.

Example

```
  "a" + 5 + 'c'
    # results a String, because one of the operand's value's type is String or Char
```

<h3>Ternary Operator</h3>
Imagine being able to use conditions in expressions. A ternary operator is a group of two operators that takes three expressions as operands.

Example

```
  2 > 1 ? "that's okay !" : "that's okay too !"
```
In this example, the first operand is a boolean expression (an expression which when evaluated, gives True or False).
The second and the third operands are expressions.

If 2 is greater than 1, then the expression should be "that's okay !", otherwise, it should be "that's okay too !".
